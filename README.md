# Central-Limit-Theorem
Using the python code the central limit theorem can be verified. 

For example a population of 50000 integers is created and random samples of sample_size= 40(greater than 25 for central limit theorem to work)

The means of the random sample nearly approximate follows a normal distribution with 
mean = mean of entire population 
standard deviation = standard deviation of population/square root of sample_size
